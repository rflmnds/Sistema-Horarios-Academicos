## Introduction

This is an Academic Schedule Management system that I made for my Final Project in my Integrated Technical High School program in the Federal Institute of Paran√°. 

And I'm getting back to it after some years working in Project Management to try to reintroduce myself in coding again and learn more "advanced" concepts.

## "Learnlog"
